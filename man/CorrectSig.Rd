\title{Correct a Signal by Subtracting a Reference Signal Scaled by a Correction Factor}
\usage{
CorrectSig(InputSig, LefSig, correct_factor)
}
\arguments{
\item{InputSig}{A named numeric vector representing the input signal to be corrected.}

\item{LefSig}{A named numeric vector representing the reference signal (e.g., leakage or background).
Must have the same names and order as \code{InputSig}.}

\item{correct_factor}{A single numeric value greater than 0 used to scale the reference signal before subtraction.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the corrected signal, with the same names as \code{InputSig}.
}
\description{
This function adjusts an input signal by subtracting a reference signal divided by a correction factor.
It is typically used to correct for background or leakage effects in signal processing.
}
\examples{
InputSig <- c(A = 0.1, B = 1, C = 0.3)
LefSig <- c(A = 0.2, B = 0.4, C = 1)
correct_factor <- 2
CorrectSig(InputSig, LefSig, correct_factor)

}
